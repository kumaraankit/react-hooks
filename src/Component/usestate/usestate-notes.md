What is the significance of usestate

The useState hooks allow us to add the state to the functional components

In classes the state is always an object but in case of functional component it could be object, array, boolean etc 

usState return 2 elements, the first value is the current value of the state and second element is use to set the state

while dealing with objects or arrays make sure to spread state variable and then use the setter function
